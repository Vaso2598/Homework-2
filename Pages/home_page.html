            Night City is an American <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacity">megacity</a> 
            in the Free State of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California">North California</a>, 
            controlled by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation">corporations</a> 
            and unassailed by the laws of both country and state. 
            It sees conflict from rampant gang wars and its ruling entities contending for dominance. 
            The city relies on robotics for everyday aspects like waste collection, maintenance, and public transportation. 
            Its visual identity is derived from the four eras it underwentâ€”austere Entropism, colourful 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch">Kitsch</a>, imposing Neo-Militarism, and opulent Neo-Kitsch. 
            Homelessness abounds but does not preclude cybernetic modification for the poor, giving rise to cosmetic addiction, and consequent violence. 
            Those whose addictions and heavy cyberization have rendered them mentally unstable, often referred to as cyberpsychos, are dealt with by the armed force known as MaxTac. 
            Trauma Team can be employed for rapid medical services. Because of the constant threat of physical harm, all citizens are allowed to carry firearms in public openly.

            The game begins with the selection of one of three lifepaths for the player character V (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Drea">Gavin Drea</a> 
            or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherami_Leigh">Cherami Leigh</a>): Nomad, Streetkid, or Corpo. 
            All three lifepaths involve V starting a new life in Night City with local thug Jackie Welles (Jason Hightower) 
            and working together as mercenaries with a netrunner, T-Bug (Cynthia Kaye McWilliams).
            In 2077, local fixer Dexter "Dex" DeShawn (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael-Leon_Wooley">Michael-Leon Wooley</a>) 
            hires V and Jackie to steal a biochip known as "the Relic" from Arasaka Corporation. 
            They acquire the Relic, but the plan goes awry when they witness the murder of the megacorp's leader 
            Saburo Arasaka (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masane_Tsukayama">Masane Tsukayama</a>) at the hands of his treacherous son Yorinobu (Hideo Kimura). 
            Yorinobu covers up the murder as poisoning and triggers a security sweep in which Arasaka's netrunners kill T-Bug. 
            V and Jackie escape, but Jackie is fatally wounded in the process, and the Relic's protective case is damaged, 
            forcing V to insert the biochip into the cyberware in their head.
